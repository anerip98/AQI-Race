* Aerosol content is significantly higher in high income neighborhoods than low income neighborhoods, only in San Francisco.
* San Francisco doesnâ€™t show strong trends like Los Angeles and San Diego. This might be because it is much smaller in area, and thus has lesser variance in pollution content.

### Elasticities between Populations of Selected Races and Air Pollution in the 3 cities

* Black, American Indian and Other race populations have a positive relationship with pollution while white and asian population contrastingly have a negative one
* There could be a strong positive correlation between NO2 emissions and Income as their primary source is through burning of fossil fuels.
